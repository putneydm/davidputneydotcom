<p> Winning over your enemy, the one person guaranteed to reject everything you are, that's real love. Don't care much for fancy parties. Too rough. You can't take the sky from me. We've got a bunch of fighters with nothing to hit, a wicca who won't-a, and the brains of our operation wears oven mitts. </p>

<p> If you say 'adorabubble,' I'm leaving. So, she's added cussing and hurling about of things to her repertoire. All the protein, vitamins and carbs of your grandma's best turkey dinner, plus fifteen percent alcohol. One of my personalities happens to be a multiple personality, but that doesn't make me a multiple personality. </p>

<p> I am obsolete. This must be what old people feel like, and Blockbuster. We live in a space ship, dear. Spike! It's Spike. And he's wearing a coat. You can't spend the rest of your life waiting for Xander to wake up and smell the hottie. The living legend needs eggs! We attack the mayor with hummus. Anyone in this much pain prays, or at least curses. Men, with your sales. How did your brain even learn human speech? I'm just so curious. No, a bad day is when someone's yellin' spooks the cattle. </p>

<p> See if you were really a witch, you'd do a spell to escape. Start with the part where Jayne gets knocked out by a ninety-pound girl, 'cause I don't think that's ever getting old. </p>

<p> See, morbid and creepifying, I got no problem with, long as she does it quiet-like. Oh my god! Did it sing? </p>
